# Output Analysis #

In this chapter, we cover the base concepts needed to work with
simulation analysis based on the Monte Carlo method. We have split
this into the following parts:

- Estimation of means and the Strong Law of Large Numbers (Law 4)

- Construction of confidence intervals and the Central Limit Theorem (Law 4)

- Multiple measures of performance (9.7)

- Estimates of correlation (Law 4)

- Output analysis for a single system

  - The stochastic process view of simulations (Law 9.2)

  - Time plots of variables (9.8)

  - A classification of simulation models (Law 9.3+)
    - Terminating simulations
    - Non-terminating simulations (steady state and cycle parameters)
