# Bonferroni Correction

A significant issue when using statistics is the [multiple comparisons problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem).
This occurs when multiple tests are performed  on the same set or when multiple inferences
are simultaneously tested on the same data set. This issue applies to testing and the
construction of confidence intervals.

The Bonferroni correction is a method to reduce the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family-wise_error_rate
(FWER) when doing multiple comparisons. The FWER refers to the probability of making one or more
false positives when performing multiple hypothesis tests. A statistical way of saying this is that it makes
the series of tests more conservative.
