# Confidence Intervals

It is highly likely that you have done some form of statistics course
or at least reviewed the first chapter {ref}`sec:prob_stats`. And therefore
have heard the idea of a confidence interval before, most like with a
definition similar to: "A confidence interval (CI) is a range of values,
calculated from sample data, that is likely to contain an unknown
population parameter (i.e. location or scale parameter)" and that
the confidence portion represents the reliability of the method used to
calculate this estimate.

A confidence interval defines a probabilistic guarantee that a parameter
will reside within an interval. Moreover, this probabilistic guarantee

## What a Confidence Interval Is Not

To Bayesians, there is a second concept that is often confused with
the confidence interval, the Credible interval. This interval defines the
possibility of a parameter residing in set of numbers within a given region
in the context of a posterior distribution. This is the concept
most people popularly associate with a confidence interval.

Credible intervals can be calculating using the simulation-sampling technique
described as Markov Chain Monte Carlo,, which is defined further in {ref}`sec:MCMC`
