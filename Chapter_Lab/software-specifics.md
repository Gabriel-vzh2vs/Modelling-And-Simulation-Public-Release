# Excel

Excel is a spreadsheet program is a part of MS Office 365
which is used for many, many things, even when it was not made for those
applications!

However, Excel is used in workplaces for simulation, modelling, and
data storage all of which are of interest in this text. In this course,
it is an option for visualizing concepts in simulation as a visualization of a
matrix with transformations and embedded functions.

## Argo (Windows-Only)

Argo is similar to XLRisk with a few changes to make it more efficient and flexible.
It is a great option for readers with Windows Machines that are interested in Simulation.

### Argo Functions

# SIMIO (Windows-Only)

## SIMIO Resources

SIMIO has quite a few resources to help make it more usable

# AnyLogic (Anything with Java on it)

## AnyLogic Resources

Anylogic, similarly to SIMIO, also has resources 

# Python Packages
