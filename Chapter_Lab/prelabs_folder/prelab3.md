# Pre-Lab 3: Fundamentals of Debugging For Simulation (Do)

Now that this text has covered a substantial amount of theory,
it is important for the reader to identify and consider malignant 
patterns in simulation, which is what this pre-lab aims to aid in
doing.

A critical part of working with complex systems and software is debugging.
In this case, this text defines debugging as a reliable, systematic method
for figuring out what is not working within a system. Traditionally,
debugging was an act of trial-and-error until the system behaved in-line
with expectations. However, there are several methods to improve debugging
and through this act, to improve the verification state of the system, which
include:

- Input-Output Analysis
- Breakpoints
- Unit Testing
- Automated Methods (Formal Methods)

Some of these methods are discussed in more detail in {ref}`sec:output_analysis`
