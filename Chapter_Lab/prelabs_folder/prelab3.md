# Pre-Lab 3: When Simulation Breaks Down (Read)

Now that this text has covered a substantial amount of theory,
it is important for the reader to consider malignant patterns
in simulation, some of these malignant patterns can be discovered
and removed with the methods discussed in {ref}`prelab-5`.

This pre-lab builds on the knowledge and theory presented in these
three papers: {cite:p}`barth2012typical` {cite:p}`robinson1999three`
{cite:p}`christie2005error`.

## On Prediction of Complex Phenomena

A common historical discussion in simulation literature is
the question: "how should complex phenomena be presented and analyzed
in simulation?" One of the papers that attempted to build a consensus
around this topic is {cite:p}`christie2005error`.

### Constraining the Model

### Inference and Prediction

### Statistical Error

## Systematic Errors in Development

### Modelling

### Data

### Experimentation

## Errors in Interpretation and Communication

In {cite:p}`barth2012typical`, they describe the existence of five
distinct pitfalls: acceptance, distraction, complexity, implementation,
and interpretation.

### Acceptance

### Distraction

### Complexity

### Implementation

### Interpretation
