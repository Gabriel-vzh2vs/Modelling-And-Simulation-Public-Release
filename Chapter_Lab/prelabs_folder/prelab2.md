# Pre-Lab 2: Tutorial for Monte Carlo Methods (Do)

This pre-lab uses XLrisk (for Excel users) and pyMC + pandas packages (for Python Users)
as the main implementation methods; however, these all of these tasks can be
done within other packages in python such as the monaco and (copulas or statsmodels) packages.

In this pre-lab we will discuss the Monte Carlo Method with its implementations
and do a short example of coin-flipping that loosely relates to Lab-2. Keep in mind that
the XLRisk and pyMC sections are almost identical on purpose.

### Functions

In XLRisk, there is a series of functions for defining a random variate, of which the bare
minimum for this pre-lab are here, with a more extensive list in {ref}`sec:software`.

- =RiskBernolli() # For a Bernoulli Variate
- =RiskUniform() # For a Uniform Variate
- =RiskCorMat() # For Copulas

### Correlations between distributions (Copula)

In this pre-lab, we consider copulas as forcing a distribution to assume the
behavior of another one, this is known as correlation. An example of this would be if a person goes to an
expensive hotel, it is more likely that they would get expensive food, tours, and everything else on their trip.  

Copulas are joint cumulative D.Fs for which the marginal D.F of each variable is bounded by $[0, 1]$ across the domain.

And the Gaussian copula, aka two distributions linked together with a copula based on a Gaussian, can take on different
appearances, depending on the marginal distributions this is an example from a completed {ref}`project-1`.

```{figure} #fig:copula
:label: fig:copula-1

An example of the correlation between Accommodation Prices and Meal Costs through a Correlation Matrix,
this is related to {ref}`project-1`.

```

In XLrisk, this behavior is implemented through the function RiskCorMat, which takes a matrix and applies it to
random variates generated by XLRisk based on user parameters.
