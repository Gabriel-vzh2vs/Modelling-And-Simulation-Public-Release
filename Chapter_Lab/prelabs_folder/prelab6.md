# Pre-Lab 6: Applications of Queuing Theory (Reading  + Do)

:::{admonition} Advisory: Pre-Lab 6 Chapter Reading
:class: warning dropdown

It is highly recommended that the reader read {ref}`sec:queuing_systems`
before reading this pre-lab, as it provides more details and critical context
about the topics discussed as this pre-lab is about applying queuing, which
is more difficult without context.

:::

Pre-lab reconstruction, it might be more appropriate for a pre-lab to not
contain theory, so this pre-lab is being reworked to have applications and
coding.
