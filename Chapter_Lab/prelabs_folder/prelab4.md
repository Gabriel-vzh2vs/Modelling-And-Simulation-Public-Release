# Pre-Lab 4: Short Overview of Modelling (Short Do)
::::{tab-set}

This pre-lab focuses on exposing the reader to different modelling schemas
that will be explored later in future pre-labs, chapters, projects, and
labs once their prerequisites are met. Essentially, this is a transition
pre-lab away from Monte Carlo to help understand the foundations of modelling.

More detailed information can be found {ref}`sec:system_modeling`, but this pre-lab
gives a sampler of different modelling methodologies.
