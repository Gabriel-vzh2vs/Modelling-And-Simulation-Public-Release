# Pre-Labs

Pre-labs are made to aid the reader with the concepts presented in the 
Laboratory Section of this book. These pre-labs consist of structured 
activities linked with the lab with the same number (e.g: Pre-Lab 1 connects to Lab 1). 

There are two categories of Pre-Lab: Read and Do. Pre-Labs marked with "Read" are 
functionally equivalent to a typical section of the book as in the reader sees examples
and learns simiarily to the rest of the sections of the book. In contrast, 
Pre-Labs marked with "Do" ask the reader to complete an exercise step-by-step that
helps the reader comprehend the tasks they need to do for the associated lab. 

Grading for the Pre-Labs is at the instructor's discretion; additionally, we recommend 
completing a pre-lab for each lab at a 1 to 1 ratio (meaning, if you do 7 labs, 
you should do 7 pre-labs). However, if you are self-studying, you can choose which 
pre-labs you do based on your knowledge level.
