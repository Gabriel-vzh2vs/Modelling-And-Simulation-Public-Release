# Introduction to Simulation Lab

The main purpose of the lab section is to help demonstrate the concepts discussed
throughout the book through short exercises and readings {ref}`sec:pre-labs`,
hands-on activities {ref}`sec:labs`, and replications of real-world systems and
models from literature {ref}`sec:projects`. More details about each of these
concepts are available in their sections.

The lab section consists of three sections that were discussed before
and three documents of information organized with the following structure:

- {ref}`sec:softwaresetup`
- {ref}`sec:pre-labs`
- {ref}`sec:labs`
- {ref}`sec:projects`
- {ref}`sec:GMP`
- {ref}`sec:software`

In this case, you should start with the Software Installation first, as
that gives a setup that enables the technological side of the pre-labs,
labs, and projects. Then, the reader should do a pre-lab for each
lab, and then once you do three or four labs, then should take on a
project.

## Suggested Grading Standards for Labs, Projects, and Pre-Labs

This section is mostly for readers who are either taking a course based on
this work or readers who have adopted this work for their courses (thanks for using this work!)
Additionally, we have included it here in the introduction to reduce unneeded
replication for each assignment. Keep in mind that these are suggested grading schemes, and
any instructor has the right to change, discard, or modify them for their course based on their
experiences, institutional policies, new advancements in educational science, or personal beliefs
(meaning if you are a reader with an instructor, check their syllabus for grading information!)

### Pre-Lab Grading Rubric

Generally, pre-labs should not be graded on a standard point scale, as they are made
to help the students understand the connection between concepts and practice. However,
they should be assessed 



### Lab Grading Rubric


### Project Grading Rubric

If you are to grade the projects as an instructor, we have provided a rough framework
for evaluating the quality of student products. Moreover, the suggested weighting for
each deliverable is as follows: 30 percent for the model and 70 percent for the report.

The reasoning behind this is two-fold, it is more important that the students know and
can describe how the model works, and a functional model is required but not sufficient for
external validity (see {ref}``).

% You can add point values here if desired, e.g., Excellent (90-100%)

\textbf{Criterion 1: Argumentation & Thesis} &
% Description for Excellent
Demonstrates a clear, insightful, and original thesis. Arguments are compelling, well-supported by evidence, and logically structured. Addresses counterarguments effectively. &
% Description for Proficient
Presents a clear thesis. Arguments are generally well-supported and logical. May show some minor weaknesses in addressing counterarguments or in the depth of analysis. &
% Description for Needs Improvement
Thesis is unclear, unoriginal, or not well-defined. Arguments are weak, poorly supported, or illogical. Fails to address counterarguments or does so superficially. \\

\textbf{Criterion 2: Evidence & Analysis} &
% Description for Excellent
Utilizes a wide range of high-quality, relevant sources. Evidence is expertly integrated and analyzed critically to support claims. Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of the material. &
% Description for Proficient
Uses appropriate sources. Evidence is generally well-integrated and analyzed to support claims. Shows good understanding of the material, though analysis could be deeper. &
% Description for Needs Improvement
Relies on insufficient, irrelevant, or low-quality sources. Evidence is poorly integrated, not analyzed, or misapplied. Shows limited understanding of the material. \\

\textbf{Criterion 3: Structure & Organization} &
% Description for Excellent
Organization is exceptionally clear and logical. Paragraphs are well-developed, cohesive, and transition smoothly. Introduction and conclusion are effective and engaging. &
% Description for Proficient
Organization is clear. Paragraphs are mostly well-developed and cohesive with adequate transitions. Introduction and conclusion are functional. &
% Description for Needs Improvement
Organization is unclear or illogical. Paragraphs lack development, coherence, or transitions. Introduction or conclusion is weak or missing. \\

\textbf{Criterion 4: Clarity, Mechanics, & Style} &
% Description for Excellent
Writing is clear, concise, and engaging. Language is precise and sophisticated. Free of errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and citation style. &
% Description for Proficient
Writing is generally clear. Language is appropriate. Minor errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, or citation style may be present but do not significantly hinder understanding. &
% Description for Needs Improvement
Writing is unclear, awkward, or difficult to follow. Frequent or significant errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, or citation style impede understanding. \\
