# Lab Section

The main purpose of the lab section is to help demonstrate the concepts discussed
throughout the book through short exercises and readings {ref}`sec:pre-labs`,
hands-on activities {ref}`sec:labs`, and replications of real-world systems and
models from literature {ref}`sec:projects`. More details about each of these
concepts are available in their sections.

The lab section consists of three sections that were discussed before
and three documents of information organized with the following structure:

- {ref}`sec:softwaresetup`
- {ref}`sec:pre-labs`
  - {ref}`prelab-1`
  - {ref}`prelab-2`
  - {ref}`prelab-3`
  - {ref}`prelab-4`
  - {ref}`prelab-5`
  - {ref}`prelab-6`
  - {ref}`prelab-7`
  - {ref}`prelab-8`
  - {ref}`prelab-9`
  - {ref}`prelab-10`
  - {ref}`prelab-11`
  - {ref}`prelab-12`
- {ref}`sec:labs`
  - {ref}`lab-1`
  - {ref}`lab-2`
  - {ref}`lab-3`
  - {ref}`lab-4`
  - {ref}`lab-5`
  - {ref}`lab-6`
  - {ref}`lab-7`
  - {ref}`lab-8`
  - {ref}`lab-9`
  - {ref}`lab-10`
  - {ref}`lab-11`
  - {ref}`lab-12`
- {ref}`sec:projects`
- {ref}`sec:GMP`
- {ref}`sec:software`

In this case, you should start with the Software Installation first, as
that gives a setup that enables the technological side of the pre-labs,
labs, and projects. Then, the reader should do a pre-lab for each
lab, and then once you do three or four labs, then should take on a
project. The other sections will appear when needed within a pre-lab,
lab or project.
