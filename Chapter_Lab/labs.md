# Lab Overview

The labs serve a dual purpose in this text, they enable the reader to apply lessons from this book to real-world examples,
and they allow for assessment of the reader's knowledge of the material either through comparing models with reference models
through self-assessment or by formal assessment by an external grader. It is recommended to do eight to eleven labs within a
course of self-study or in the context of a formal course in simulation. In this case it is recommended that the number of labs
that a reader does correlates with their educational goals, for example: eight to nine labs for am advanced undergraduate-level
understanding of Simulation and Modelling, and ten to eleven labs being suitable for a graduate-level understanding.  

Moreover, these labs are written to be technology-agnostic - meaning that you could theoretically use any toolkit to
complete these tasks; however, we have included recommendations for specific technological implementations as a guide for
readers as the authors used them in the creation of the labs.

In accordance with technological agnosticism and to show how literature presents their case studies, lab descriptions are written
with a modified ODD (Overview, Design concepts and Details) protocol that is shortened based on the model's
requirements (e.g: sections that do not apply to the model, or sections that are left to the reader to complete).

:::{note} A Note on Difficulty Levels
:class: dropdown

In this section, difficulty is expressed by a symbol and a color, which are dual indicators
meaning that they will always go together (i.e: you will never see a color with a different symbols)

- Green and Pen: Labs that we consider approachable and should take the average prepared student less than 1 hour to complete;
- Orange and Megaphone: Labs that we consider will take a bit of thought, we recommend taking 1 to 2 hours to complete this task;
- Red and Circle: Labs that are made to prepare the student for the project, we recommend taking 5+ hours to complete this lab.

Additionally, if you do not complete the pre-lab, you can move each difficulty level up by one (e.g: Green and Pen goes to Orange and Megaphone).
