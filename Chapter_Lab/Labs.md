# Labs
The labs serve a dual purpose in this text, they enable the reader apply lessons from this book to real-world examples, and they allow for assessment of the reader's knowledge of the material either through comparing models with reference models through self-assessment or by formal assessment by an external grader. It is recommended to do seven to eight labs within a course, as some labs may take longer to fully understand and go through.

## Questions to Think about: 

1. Are the sample variance and deviation similar enough to the population variance and deviation to state that we have a sufficient N for normality?
2. What are your 25% percentile, median, and 75% percentile values, and what do they say about the extreme values? (XLrisk will provide this), and using this information, would you say that this portfolio would pay off (have a positive value if we subtract the E[X] from the FV), in a week, which is our length of simulation.
3. Given the Kurtosis of the Model from XLrisk, what would you say about extreme events with this portfolio?
4. If you change the mixture of the stocks from all equal to only one stock, MSTR, what happens to the variance, and why? And how does connect to portfolio stategries in the real world?
