# Labs
The labs serve a dual purpose in this text, they enable the reader apply lessons from this book to real-world examples, and they allow for assessment of the reader's knowledge of the material either through comparing models with reference models through self-assessment or by formal assessment by an external grader. It is recommended to do seven to eight labs within a course, as some labs may take longer to fully understand and go through.


# Lab 1: Computing $\pi$ with Monte Carlo Methods (Excel)
# Lab 2: Retirement Calculations with Monte Carlo Methods (XLRisk)
# Lab 3: Building a Portfolio with Monte Carlo Methods (XLRisk)
# Lab 4: Posterior Probablity Estimation with Monte Carlo Methods (Python + Excel)
# Lab 5: Foundations of Modelling (SIMIO, Anylogic, or Python)
# Lab 6: Markovian Queuing Methods (Python's CTW, SIMIO, or Anylogic)
