# Pre-Lab Overview

Pre-labs are made to aid the reader with the concepts presented in the
Laboratory Section of this book. These pre-labs consist of structured
activities linked with the lab with the same number (e.g: Pre-Lab 1 connects to Lab 1).

There are two categories of Pre-Lab: Read and Do. Pre-Labs marked with "Read" are
functionally equivalent to a typical section of the book as in the reader sees examples
and learns similarly to the rest of the sections of the book. In contrast,
Pre-Labs marked with "Do" ask the reader to complete an exercise step-by-step that
helps the reader comprehend the tasks they need to do for the associated lab. Additionally,
Pre-labs marked with "Do" may not be as theory-based as labs marked with "Read".

Some pre-labs might be marked with "short", this means that they are pre-labs
that rely on the rest of the book for support and often these are used to transition
between topics and introduce different topics.

Grading for the Pre-Labs is at the instructor's discretion as described in
{ref}`sec:labs`; additionally, we recommend completing a pre-lab for each lab
at a 1 to 1 ratio. However, if you are self-studying, 
you can choose which pre-labs you do dependent on your knowledge level.
