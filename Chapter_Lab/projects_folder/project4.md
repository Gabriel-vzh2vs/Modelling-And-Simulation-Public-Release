## Project 4 Model Information

This model is based loosely on {cite:p}`griffiths2010simulation` for its base description. You are a consultant working for the
English healthcare system (England NHS) for the Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust who is attempting to
reduce cancellations of elective surgeries and reducing staffing while maintaining a reasonable amount of
bed-occupancy and waiting times. Moreover, the scope of your project is the beds in
the hospital along with their sources (Emergency Room, Radiology, Elective Surgery, and Hospital Transfers).
