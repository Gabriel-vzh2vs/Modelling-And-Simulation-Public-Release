# Welcome to Modeling and Simulation! #

This is a live textbook that will support SYS 3062 Discrete Event
Simulation in the spring semester of 2026. It is work in progress, but
we the authors will strive to have content ready by the time it is
needed in the lecture. And usually beforehand.

The other course textbook is {cite}`Law:13`. This is one of the
standard textbooks on the topic, contains a wealth of information and
has a review of literature. It is a good reference to have. Please
note that there is a 6th edition of the book, but that we will be
using the 5th edition in this round. You will find other references on
the course syllabus in Canvas.


__Who is this live textbook for?__ For you, the student of SYS 3062,
obviously. But the book will also contain more advanced material, as
well as supporiting material and topics from mathematics (e.g., ODEs),
machine learning, and more. It is a book that will keep growing.


__License and disclaimer:__ The material in this book, the source
code, Jupyter notebooks, as well as other materials, are made
available to you for free. While we have taken care writing the source
code, you, the user of the code or materials, assume all risks,
