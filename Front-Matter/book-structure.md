# Book and course structure #

__Synopsis:__ these are working notes intended to structure (a) the
book project and (b) to guide a semester-long course, its lectures,
quizzes, homeworks, exams, lab & lab projects. It also talks about
software.


1. Week 1: Conducting a quiz to assess students on probability,
statistics and modeling. Immediate homework. The three cooks and Buffon's needle.

2. Convincing examples of stochastic models and how we can analyze
these. With computational examples.

3. Emphasizing the point that the models are stochastic and what that means in terms of analysis.

4. Roadmap. The roadmap may serve as a clickable table of contents.

5. Modeling and simulation examples. Including queueing.

6. Output analysis

7. RNG and generating variates from arbitrary distributions

8.




## Software ##

- Python: a main focus. Assumed and not discussed.

- Excel w/XLRisk plugin. Seems appreciated. Generally useful for many in their work environments.

- AnyLogic: to be evaluated. Likely candidate for queueing systems
