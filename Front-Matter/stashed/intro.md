This book contains a sequence of topics that could form the basis for
an advanced undergraduate or a graduate course in simulation and
modeling. It covers theory and practice. While you may learn a lot
from just studying theory, it is the authors' opinion that
"getting your hands dirty" implementing models and running simulations
will truly deepen your understanding in a way that theory alone cannot
do.

We have strived to make this book self-contained, but given the nature
of the field, we encourage the reader to explore the literature. The
following resources shaped a lot of the content in this book:

- {cite}`Banks:14`: comments

- {cite}`Law:13` : Describes theory in detail; has an extensive list
  of references;

- More

Here we have attempted the lofty goal of making a book that combines
the strengths of these resources in an exposition that is suited for
advanced undergraduate students and graduate students.
