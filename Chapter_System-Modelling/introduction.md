#  Introduction #

You have likely done some form of modeling. As we indicated in the
introduction under {ref}`sec:intro_sim`, models range from a basic
level to highly complex for complex system. While we do not have a
strong focus on modeling in this book, it is still beneficial to work
from a basic foundation which is what this chapter seeks to set up.


## Model paradigms ##

Continuous

Discrete

Hybrid

Agent-based modeling

Finite state machines

Stochastic models


## Modeling and scale ##

Multi-scale and big-data. Nobody wants single-scaled models fueled by medium-sized data.


## Modeling in the real world ##

A key aspect of modeling is validation. As we saw in
{ref}`sec:intro_validation`, this is about ensuring that the model $M$
is sufficiently detailed and precise so that we can adequately address
the questions that we intend to answer about the system
$S$. Verification, on the other hand, seeks to ensure that the model
$M$ is accurately committed to code. One may regard verification and
validation as conceptually separate processes. This point of view is
perfectly fine for basic models. However, as one seeks to analyze
complex system, one will often find that the modeling paradigms that
one chooses to apply will be
