# Examples of statistical distributions


In this section ...

- Background and introductory examples (see, e.g., {cite}`Law:13`
  Section 6.1)



- The notion of __location, scale, and shape parameters__ of
  continuous, parametric distributions. Illustrations using __common
  continuous and discrete parametrized distributions__ from, e.g.,
  Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 in {cite}`Law:13` or the Wikipedia. Such
  listings will often include the ``MLEs''. These are the __maximum
  likelihood estimators__ for the parameters of the distribution.
