Strong Law of Large Numbers
    The Strong Law of Large Numbers implies that for almost every 
    sequence of outcomes, the sample average $\bar{X_n}$ will eventually 
    converge to $\mu$ as the number of trials $n$ goes to infinity. 
    The set of outcome sequences for which  $\bar{X_n}$ does not 
    converge to $\mu$ has a total probability of zero.

Weak Law of Large Numbers
    The Weak Law of Large Numbers says that for a sufficiently large number of trials 
    n, the probability that the sample average $\bar{X_n}$ will be off by greater 
    than $\epsilon$  from the true mean $\mu$ becomes very small, approaching zero. 
    Therefore, there is no guarantee that $\bar{X_n}$ will converge to 
    $\mu$, but rather that the chances of it straying significantly become increasingly 
    unlikely as n grows.

Experiments
    A single, complete execution of the simulation process driven by a 
    set of randomly generated inputs. Additionally, The collection of many 
    experiments forms the basis of the Monte Carlo Method. Mathematically,
    an experiment is a mapping from a sampled point in the domain to a 
    point in the output space (Co-domain), via the model function.
