abstract = {UVA-EpiHiper is a national scale agent-based model to support the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH). UVA-EpiHiper uses a detailed representation of the underlying social contact network along with data measured during the course of the pandemic to initialize and calibrate the model. In this paper, we study the role of heterogeneity on model complexity and resulting epidemic dynamics using UVA-EpiHiper. We discuss various sources of heterogeneity that we encounter in the use of UVA-EpiHiper to support modeling and analysis of epidemic dynamics under various scenarios. We also discuss how this affects model complexity and computational complexity of the corresponding simulations. Using round 13 of the SMH as an example, we discuss how UVA-EpiHiper was initialized and calibrated. We then discuss how the detailed output produced by UVA-EpiHiper can be analyzed to obtain interesting insights. We find that despite the complexity in the model, the software, and the computation incurred to an agent-based model in scenario modeling, it is capable of capturing various heterogeneities of real-world systems, especially those in networks and behaviors, and enables analyzing heterogeneities in epidemiological outcomes between different demographic, geographic, and social cohorts. In applying UVA-EpiHiper to round 13 scenario modeling, we find that disease outcomes are different between and within states, and between demographic groups, which can be attributed to heterogeneities in population demographics, network structures, and initial immunity.}

abstract="Health care systems can be evaluated from four perspectives: macro, regional, center, and department. In each case, reduction of patient delay depends on improving interfaces as patients are transferred from activity to activity or department to department. This chapter presents basic tools for resolving delays at interfaces, through mapping the processes by which patients are served, and by developing and implementing measures of system performance. These tools are demonstrated through a case study of the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Hospital.",
