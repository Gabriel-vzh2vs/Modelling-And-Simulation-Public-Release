UVA-EpiHiper uses a detailed representation of the underlying social contact network along with data measured during the course of the pandemic to initialize and calibrate the model. In this paper, we study the role of heterogeneity on model complexity and resulting epidemic dynamics using UVA-EpiHiper. We discuss various sources of heterogeneity that we encounter in the use of UVA-EpiHiper to support modeling and analysis of epidemic dynamics under various scenarios. We also discuss how this affects model complexity and computational complexity of the corresponding simulations. Using round 13 of the SMH as an example, we discuss how UVA-EpiHiper was initialized and calibrated. We then discuss how the detailed output produced by UVA-EpiHiper can be analyzed to obtain interesting insights. We find that despite the complexity in the model, the software, and the computation incurred to an agent-based model in scenario modeling, it is capable of capturing various heterogeneities of real-world systems, especially those in networks and behaviors, and enables analyzing heterogeneities in epidemiological outcomes between different demographic, geographic, and social cohorts. In applying UVA-EpiHiper to round 13 scenario modeling, we find that disease outcomes are different between and within states, and between demographic groups, which can be attributed to heterogeneities in population demographics, network structures, and initial immunity.}

This chapter presents basic tools for resolving delays at interfaces, through mapping the processes by which patients are served, and by developing and implementing measures of system performance.

abstract = "In this paper we prove from a new angle that Dempster{\textquoteright}s rule is inherently probabilistic, extends Bayes{\textquoteright} rule, and reduces to Bayes{\textquoteright} rule when precise probabilities are available, regardless of whether prior is uniform. We use examples to demonstrate this equivalence. Additionally, we explain that the Evidential Reasoning (ER) rule is also probabilistic and includes Bayes{\textquoteright} and Dempster{\textquoteright}s rules as special cases. Furthermore, we address some criticisms of the behaviour of Dempster{\textquoteright}s rule from a probabilistic perspective and explain the rationality of the behaviour. We also identify instances where such critiques were misapplied. Finally, we clarify vital differences between belief degrees in belief functions and basic probabilities and highlight the critical differences between Shafer{\textquoteright}s discounting method and the ER rule. These differences make the latter probabilistic, while the former is not. Our motivation is to show that evidence theory has a probabilistic foundation and is possible to become probabilistic again.

(Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case R(X, F) = θ(F̂) - θ(F), θ some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc.},
