# The Monte Carlo Method #


A good overview of the Monte Carlo method can be found on the
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).  You
have already seen the method at work in {ref}`sec:buffons_needle`. For
this book, it has the following elements.

1. A stochastic model with one or more random variables

2. Sampling of the random variables and computations of observables
(aka outputs or measurements).

3. Aggregations of results

It is important that the results that are aggregated are
__independent__, something we cover in {ref}`sec:output_analysis`. One
can also use it for other types of computations, some of which we will
illustrate later and in exercises. (Integration)

Note that some say "Monte Carlo method" while others say "Monte Carlo
simulation". You can read more about this on the Wikipedia page. Here
we will simply use the phrase "Monte Carlo method".

We give another illustration of its use in
{ref}`sec:vacation_planning`, but will use this method all throughout
as it is central to simulation-based analysis.
